This documentation page explains the basic CRUD operations CouchRest makes available. CRUD stands
for **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate and **D**elete.

# Assumptions

In all examples we assume, that you configured your __CouchRest BasePath__ to be `/api/`!

Furthermore, there is the following entity, which has been published via `@CouchRest`:

```

public class Tree {
    
}
```
